# My dotfiles!

I can't make any promises of quality, functionality, or aesthetic beauty, but I like them.
I don't know if these files are copyrightable, but if they are, they're CC0.

This config is based on a keyboard-driven workflow, with mouse control when it makes sense.

* Arch Linux
* Cosmic Desktop
* Kitty Terminal
* Firefox w/ Vimium extension
* Neovim
* Fish shell
